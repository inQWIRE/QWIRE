# QWIRE

This is a Coq implementation of the QWIRE quantum programming language, described in the following papers by Jennifer Paykin, Robert Rand, Dong-Ho Lee and Steve Zdancewic:
- [QWIRE: a core language for quantum circuits][1].
- [QWIRE Practice: Formal Verification of Quantum Circuits in Coq][2]
- [ReQWIRE: Reasoning about Reversible Quantum Circuits][3]
- [Phantom Types for Quantum Programs][4]

Rennela and Staton's [Classical Control, Quantum Circuits and Linear Logic in Enriched Category Theory][5] provides a categorical semantics for QWIRE.

This version of QWIRE is compatible with Coq version 8.19.

This project depends on [QuantumLib](https://github.com/inQWIRE/QuantumLib) version 1.6.0, which you can install with: 
```
opam pin coq-quantumlib 1.6.0 https://github.com/inQWIRE/QuantumLib.git
```
Run `make` to compile the core (preliminary and implementation) files and `make all` to compile proofs of QWIRE programs. Run `make qasm` to compile the files that convert QWIRE to QASM. We recommend using [Company Coq][9] with QWIRE in light of its support for unicode.
